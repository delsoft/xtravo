Xtravo
======

Xtravo Browser was developed by me when I was 19 years old. 

Xtravo will mark it's 5th year on November 12th 2013. As a gift back to the community, I want developers to make use of it's source code and use it for their application.


Information
===========
Xtravo to date as been on .NET and using Trident engine. I request developers around the world to use WebKit or Chromium Project in Xtravo for it's newer versions to release it.

Newer version will be available on Xtravo's website for users.
